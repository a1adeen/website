            Law 1: Never Outshine the <span class="highlight"> Master</span> - This law advises against making your superior look bad, insecure, or threatened in any way. By appearing to be less ambitious, less talented, and less successful than your superior, you can avoid being seen as a threat and can make them feel more secure and comfortable around you.

                law 2: So Much Depends on <span class="highlight">Reputation</span> - Guard it with Your Life - This law emphasizes the importance of reputation in gaining and maintaining power. Your reputation can make or break your ability to influence and persuade others, so it's important to cultivate a strong reputation and protect it at all costs.

            <p><id=:"third" class="blue"></id>
                Law 7: Get Others to Do the Work for You, but Always Take the Credit - This law advises against doing all the work yourself and instead delegating tasks to others. By taking credit for the work of others, you can increase your reputation and power without doing as much actual work. However, you must be careful not to appear lazy or take credit for the work of others too often, as this can backfire and harm your reputation.
